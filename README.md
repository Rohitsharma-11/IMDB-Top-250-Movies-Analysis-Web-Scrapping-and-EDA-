# üé¨ IMDb Top 250 ‚Äî Web Scraping, Data Cleaning & EDA

## üß† Project by: Rohit Sharma

## üìå Project Description

This project scrapes the **IMDb Top 250 Movies** and performs **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns across ratings, genres, runtimes, release years, and directors.  
The scraping workflow handles **pagination** and **dynamic content** using **Beautiful Soup** and **Selenium**. Visualizations produced during EDA are available in this repository.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Movie recommendation and catalog systems benefit from clean, reliable metadata. The aim of this project is to:
- **Programmatically collect** the Top 250 movie metadata from IMDb.
- **Clean and standardize** the dataset for analysis.
- **Explore** genre trends, ratings distribution, decade-wise patterns, and key contributors.
- **Surface insights** that help understand what defines a top-rated film.

## üß© Project Overview

We collected and analyzed metadata for the **Top 250 movies on IMDb**, focusing on:
- Year-wise and decade-wise release trends
- IMDb rating distribution and outliers
- Popular genres and multi-genre combinations
- Runtime distribution and its link to ratings
- Directors and countries that frequently appear in the Top 250

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python**: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`, `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Automation/Drivers**: Selenium WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver)
- **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- **Environment**: Jupyter/Notebook or Python scripts

---

## üßæ Data Understanding

Typical fields collected (subject to page structure):
- `title`, `year`, `rating`, `rank`
- `genre` (single or multiple)
- `duration` (runtime in minutes)
- `average_rating`
- 'total number of rating'

Raw data is saved to: `Scrapped Data/IMDB_top250.csv`  
Cleaned data is saved to: `Scrapped Data/IMDB_Top250_Cleaned.csv`

---

## üßº Data Cleaning

- **Column standardization**: consistent names, types, and ordering
- **Type casting**: `year` ‚Üí int, `rating` ‚Üí float, `duration` ‚Üí int, `votes` ‚Üí int
- **Parsing**: split multi-genre strings into lists; extract numeric fields
- **Duplicates & nulls**: drop duplicates, fill or drop nulls where appropriate
- **Derived columns**:
  - `decade` (e.g., 1990s, 2000s)
  - `title_clean` (stripped/pattern-cleaned title)

## üìç Insights Derived

1. **Ratings Cluster at the Top End**  
   Top 250 ratings tend to cluster above ~8.0, with a few outliers near 9.0+.

2. **Genre Concentration**  
   Drama and Crime often dominate, with frequent combinations like **Drama‚ÄìCrime**, **Drama‚ÄìThriller**, and **Drama‚ÄìRomance**.

3. **Era Effects**  
   Certain decades (e.g., 1990s‚Äì2000s) show dense representation, hinting at strong cinematic output.

4. **Runtime Sweet Spot**  
   Many top films cluster between **120‚Äì150 minutes**; extremes exist but are less common.

5. **Director Footprints**  
   A handful of directors appear repeatedly; their averages typically remain high even with a higher film count.

*(Your specific insights may vary based on the scrape and cleaning rules applied.)*

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

- **Pagination & partial listing**: Initial attempts only returned the first 25 titles; addressed by identifying page/offset parameters or iterating over dynamic loads.
- **Dynamic content for genres & details**: Some attributes revealed only after interactions (e.g., expanding a panel). **Selenium** was used to render and interact with these elements.
- **Anti-bot/403 issues**: Added appropriate headers, delays, and error-handling; switched to Selenium where necessary.

---

## üöÄ Future Scope

- Build a **dashboard** (e.g., Streamlit) to explore Top 250 interactively.  
- Add **time-series refresh** to track list changes over time.  
- Enrich with **external metadata** (awards, box office, countries).  
- Train **recommendation or clustering models** using embeddings of plot/genre metadata.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Outcome

A reliable pipeline that:
- Scrapes Top 250 metadata (handling dynamic content and pagination)  
- Produces a clean, analysis-ready dataset  
- Generates visualizations that explain trends across genres, ratings, decades, and runtimes
