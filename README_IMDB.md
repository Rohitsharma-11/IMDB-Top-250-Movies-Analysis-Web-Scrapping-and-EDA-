# üé¨ IMDb Top 250 ‚Äî Web Scraping, Data Cleaning & EDA

## üß† Project by: Rohit Sharma

---

## üìå Project Description

This project scrapes the **IMDb Top 250 Movies** and performs **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns across ratings, genres, runtimes, release years, and directors.  
The scraping workflow handles **pagination** and **dynamic content** using **Beautiful Soup** and **Selenium**. Visualizations produced during EDA are available in this repository.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Movie recommendation and catalog systems benefit from clean, reliable metadata. The aim of this project is to:
- **Programmatically collect** the Top 250 movie metadata from IMDb.
- **Clean and standardize** the dataset for analysis.
- **Explore** genre trends, ratings distribution, decade-wise patterns, and key contributors.
- **Surface insights** that help understand what defines a top-rated film.

## üß© Project Overview

We collected and analyzed metadata for the **Top 250 movies on IMDb**, focusing on:
- Year-wise and decade-wise release trends
- IMDb rating distribution and outliers
- Popular genres and multi-genre combinations
- Runtime distribution and its link to ratings
- Directors and countries that frequently appear in the Top 250

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python**: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`, `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Automation/Drivers**: Selenium WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver)
- **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- **Environment**: Jupyter/Notebook or Python scripts

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rohitsharma-11/IMDB-Top-250-Movies-Analysis-Web-Scrapping-and-EDA.git
   cd IMDB-Top-250-Movies-Analysis-Web-Scrapping-and-EDA
   ```

2. **Create & activate a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the scraper (Selenium-based for dynamic content)**
   ```bash
   python src/scrape_imdb_top250_selenium.py
   ```

5. **Run the BeautifulSoup (static) fallback (if needed)**
   ```bash
   python src/scrape_imdb_top250_bs4.py
   ```

6. **Open the EDA notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/EDA_IMDb_Top250.ipynb
   ```

> **Note:** Make sure the appropriate **WebDriver** (e.g., ChromeDriver) is installed and on your PATH. For dynamic panels (like genres) and infinite/paginated sections, Selenium is used to render and interact with the page.

## üßæ Data Understanding

Typical fields collected (subject to page structure):
- `title`, `year`, `rating`, `rank`
- `genre` (single or multiple)
- `duration` (runtime in minutes)
- `director`, `cast_top`
- `votes`, `metascore` (if available)
- `certificate` / `content_rating` (if available)
- `url` (movie page)

Raw data is saved to: `data/raw/imdb_top250_raw.csv`  
Cleaned data is saved to: `data/processed/imdb_top250_clean.csv`

---

## üßº Data Cleaning

- **Column standardization**: consistent names, types, and ordering
- **Type casting**: `year` ‚Üí int, `rating` ‚Üí float, `duration` ‚Üí int, `votes` ‚Üí int
- **Parsing**: split multi-genre strings into lists; extract numeric fields
- **Duplicates & nulls**: drop duplicates, fill or drop nulls where appropriate
- **Derived columns**:
  - `decade` (e.g., 1990s, 2000s)
  - `primary_genre` (first listed genre)
  - `title_clean` (stripped/pattern-cleaned title)

---

## üìä EDA

Visualizations are available in the repository (see the **Images** or **Plots** folder, or the EDA notebook). Common analyses include:

### ‚≠ê Rating Distribution
- Histogram/KDE of IMDb ratings across the Top 250.

### üé≠ Genre Landscape
- Top genres and frequent multi-genre combinations.
- Share of movies by primary genre.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Runtime Patterns
- Distribution of runtimes; long vs short movies in the Top 250.

### üóìÔ∏è Decade Trends
- Count of movies per decade; golden eras of cinema.

### üé¨ Directors & Contributors
- Most frequent directors in the list.
- Average rating by director (min movie count threshold).

### üåç Country/Language (if scraped)
- Distribution by production country/language (where available).

> **Note:** Plots are exported from the EDA notebook to the repository. Check the `Images/` or `Plots/` directory.

## üìç Insights Derived

1. **Ratings Cluster at the Top End**  
   Top 250 ratings tend to cluster above ~8.0, with a few outliers near 9.0+.

2. **Genre Concentration**  
   Drama and Crime often dominate, with frequent combinations like **Drama‚ÄìCrime**, **Drama‚ÄìThriller**, and **Drama‚ÄìRomance**.

3. **Era Effects**  
   Certain decades (e.g., 1990s‚Äì2000s) show dense representation, hinting at strong cinematic output.

4. **Runtime Sweet Spot**  
   Many top films cluster between **120‚Äì150 minutes**; extremes exist but are less common.

5. **Director Footprints**  
   A handful of directors appear repeatedly; their averages typically remain high even with a higher film count.

*(Your specific insights may vary based on the scrape and cleaning rules applied.)*

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

- **Pagination & partial listing**: Initial attempts only returned the first 25 titles; addressed by identifying page/offset parameters or iterating over dynamic loads.
- **Dynamic content for genres & details**: Some attributes revealed only after interactions (e.g., expanding a panel). **Selenium** was used to render and interact with these elements.
- **Anti-bot/403 issues**: Added appropriate headers, delays, and error-handling; switched to Selenium where necessary.
- **HTML structure changes**: Wrote resilient selectors (CSS/XPath) and fallback logic.

---

## üöÄ Future Scope

- Build a **dashboard** (e.g., Streamlit) to explore Top 250 interactively.  
- Add **time-series refresh** to track list changes over time.  
- Enrich with **external metadata** (awards, box office, countries).  
- Train **recommendation or clustering models** using embeddings of plot/genre metadata.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Outcome

A reliable pipeline that:
- Scrapes Top 250 metadata (handling dynamic content and pagination)  
- Produces a clean, analysis-ready dataset  
- Generates visualizations that explain trends across genres, ratings, decades, and runtimes
